# Blockchain-Network
This project is a  demonstration of blockchain technology, implemented using Node.js and Socket.IO. Designed to simulate a fully functional cryptocurrency blockchain, DiyaCoinage enables users to perform transactions, mine new blocks, and view the entire blockchain. Beyond basic blockchain functionalities like handling transactions and block mining, this project also incorporates essential peer-to-peer network features using Socket.IO. This enables nodes to effectively communicate and synchronize data, ensuring consistency and reliability across the network.
